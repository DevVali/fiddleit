# Translating

The guide for translating. 

## How to translate guide
1. We have example: `"title" => "online code editor",`. The `"title"` (first item) is ID of text with name `title`. Please **don't modify** that.
2. The `"online code editor"` (second item) is content of the ID. This is what you see in our app and what you will translate. Please edit this text with translation to your language. 
3. **Don't** remove the double-quotes. Please type the translation into the double-quotes.
3. Example of translation to Slovak language: `"title" => "online editor k√≥du",`
